# Technical Analysis Guide

## Core Principles

### 1. Trend is Your Friend
```
Primary Trend (6+ months): Bull/Bear/Sideways
Secondary Trend (1-6 months): Corrections/Reactions
Minor Trend (<1 month): Daily fluctuations
```

### 2. Price Discounts Everything
All information (fundamental, news, sentiment) is reflected in price.

### 3. History Tends to Repeat
Price patterns repeat due to market psychology.

## Essential Indicators

### Moving Averages (MA)

#### Types
```
Simple Moving Average (SMA):
- 5/10/20 days: Short-term
- 60/120 days: Medium-term
- 250 days: Long-term (yearly)

Exponential Moving Average (EMA):
- More weight to recent prices
- Faster to react
- 12/26 days common
```

#### Signals
```
Bullish Signals:
- Price above MA
- Short MA above Long MA (Golden Cross)
- MA sloping upward
- Price bounces off MA support

Bearish Signals:
- Price below MA
- Short MA below Long MA (Death Cross)
- MA sloping downward
- Price rejected at MA resistance
```

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

#### Calculation
```
RSI = 100 - [100 / (1 + RS)]

Where:
RS = Average Gain / Average Loss
Period: Typically 14 days
```

#### Interpretation
```
Overbought: RSI > 70
- Potential pullback
- Don't short immediately
- Look for confirmation

Oversold: RSI < 30
- Potential bounce
- Don't buy immediately
- Wait for reversal signals

Neutral: RSI 30-70
- Trend continuation
- Normal fluctuation
```

#### Divergence
```
Bullish Divergence:
- Price makes lower low
- RSI makes higher low
- Signal: Potential reversal up

Bearish Divergence:
- Price makes higher high
- RSI makes lower high
- Signal: Potential reversal down
```

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

#### Components
```
MACD Line: 12-day EMA - 26-day EMA
Signal Line: 9-day EMA of MACD
Histogram: MACD - Signal Line
```

#### Signals
```
Bullish:
- MACD crosses above Signal (Golden Cross)
- MACD above zero
- Histogram increasing

Bearish:
- MACD crosses below Signal (Death Cross)
- MACD below zero
- Histogram decreasing

Divergence:
- Similar to RSI
- Strong reversal signal
```

### Volume Analysis

#### Principles
```
Price + Volume = Confirmation

Bullish Volume Patterns:
- Price up, volume up (healthy)
- Price down, volume down (weak selling)
- Breakout with high volume (strong)

Bearish Volume Patterns:
- Price down, volume up (panic selling)
- Price up, volume down (weak rally)
- Breakdown with high volume (strong)
```

#### Volume Indicators
```
On-Balance Volume (OBV):
- Cumulative volume
- Confirms trend
- Divergence signals reversal

Volume Profile:
- Price levels with high volume
- Support/resistance identification
```

### Support and Resistance

#### Identification
```
Support (Demand Zone):
- Previous lows
- Horizontal price levels
- Trend line touches
- Round numbers

Resistance (Supply Zone):
- Previous highs
- Horizontal price levels
- Trend line touches
- Round numbers
```

#### Breakouts and Breakdowns
```
Breakout Confirmation:
- Close above resistance
- Volume expansion
- Retest of broken resistance (now support)

Breakdown Confirmation:
- Close below support
- Volume expansion
- Retest of broken support (now resistance)
```

## Chart Patterns

### Reversal Patterns

#### Head and Shoulders (Top)
```
Structure:
1. Left shoulder: High with volume
2. Head: Higher high, lower volume
3. Right shoulder: Lower high, low volume
4. Neckline: Connects lows

Target: Neckline - (Head - Neckline)
```

#### Double Top/Bottom
```
Double Top (M-shape):
- Two highs at similar level
- Volume decreasing on second top
- Break below middle low confirms

Double Bottom (W-shape):
- Two lows at similar level
- Volume increasing on second bottom
- Break above middle high confirms
```

### Continuation Patterns

#### Ascending/Descending Triangle
```
Ascending Triangle (Bullish):
- Flat resistance
- Rising support
- Breakout above resistance

Descending Triangle (Bearish):
- Flat support
- Falling resistance
- Breakdown below support
```

#### Flag and Pennant
```
Characteristics:
- Sharp price move (flagpole)
- Small consolidation (flag/pennant)
- Breakout in direction of flagpole

Target: Flagpole length
```

## Trend Analysis

### Trend Lines
```
Uptrend Line:
- Connect higher lows
- Should touch at least 3 points
- Slope: 30-45 degrees optimal

Downtrend Line:
- Connect lower highs
- Should touch at least 3 points
- Slope: 30-45 degrees optimal
```

### Channel Trading
```
Ascending Channel:
- Upper trend line (resistance)
- Lower trend line (support)
- Trade within channel
- Breakout signals trend change

Descending Channel:
- Same concept, opposite direction
```

## Time Frames

### Multiple Time Frame Analysis
```
Long-term (Monthly/Weekly):
- Primary trend
- Major support/resistance
- Overall market structure

Medium-term (Daily):
- Intermediate trend
- Key patterns
- Entry/exit levels

Short-term (Hourly/15-min):
- Timing precision
- Intraday patterns
- Fine-tuning entries
```

### Rule of Thumb
```
Trade in direction of long-term trend
Use medium-term for setup
Use short-term for timing
```

## Risk Management in Technical Analysis

### Stop Loss Placement
```
Method 1: Below Support
- Place below recent low
- Below trend line
- Below moving average

Method 2: Percentage-Based
- 5-8% below entry (conservative)
- 10-15% below entry (aggressive)

Method 3: ATR-Based
- 1.5-2x ATR below entry
- Volatility-adjusted
```

### Position Sizing
```
Risk per trade: 1-2% of capital
Stop loss distance: X%
Position size = (Capital × Risk%) / X%

Example:
Capital: 100,000
Risk: 2% (2,000)
Stop distance: 8%
Position size = 2,000 / 0.08 = 25,000
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-reliance on indicators**: Use 2-3 max
2. **Ignoring volume**: Price moves need confirmation
3. **Fighting trend**: Trade with trend
4. **Too many time frames**: Stick to 2-3
5. **No stop loss**: Always use stops
6. **Chasing breakouts**: Wait for retest
7. **Ignoring market context**: Consider overall market

## Best Practices

### Analysis Routine
```
1. Check long-term trend
2. Identify key levels
3. Look for patterns
4. Confirm with indicators
5. Check volume
6. Assess risk/reward
7. Plan entry/exit
```

### Confirmation Checklist
- [ ] Trend direction clear
- [ ] Key levels identified
- [ ] Pattern recognized
- [ ] Indicators aligned
- [ ] Volume confirms
- [ ] Risk/reward acceptable (>2:1)
- [ ] Market context supportive

## Technical Analysis Limitations

- **Not predictive**: Identifies probabilities, not certainties
- **Self-fulfilling**: Many traders watch same levels
- **False signals**: Always possible
- **Context matters**: Must consider fundamentals and market environment
- **Requires discipline**: Emotions can override signals

---

**Key Takeaway**: Technical analysis is a tool for timing and risk management, not a crystal ball. Combine it with fundamental analysis for best results.
