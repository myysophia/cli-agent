# Risk Management & Portfolio Allocation

## Personal Risk Assessment

### Psychological Risk Tolerance

#### Questionnaire
```
1. If your portfolio drops 20%, you would:
   A) Panic and sell everything
   B) Feel nervous but hold
   C) See it as buying opportunity

2. Your investment timeline is:
   A) Less than 1 year
   B) 1-3 years
   C) 3+ years

3. You need this money soon:
   A) Yes, within 1 year
   B) Maybe in 2-3 years
   C) No, long-term only

4. Your reaction to volatility:
   A) Can't sleep, check constantly
   B) Monitor regularly
   C) Check occasionally

Scoring:
- Mostly A: Low risk tolerance
- Mostly B: Medium risk tolerance
- Mostly C: High risk tolerance
```

### Financial Risk Capacity

#### Income Stability
```
Stable: Government, large corporation, tenured
  → Higher risk capacity

Variable: Commission-based, contract, startup
  → Medium risk capacity

Unstable: Freelance, seasonal, new business
  → Lower risk capacity
```

#### Emergency Fund
```
Rule: 3-6 months expenses saved

If <3 months: Reduce investment risk
If 3-6 months: Moderate risk
If >6 months: Can take more risk
```

#### Debt Situation
```
High-interest debt (>10%):
  → Pay off first, minimal investing

Moderate debt (5-10%):
  → Balance debt payoff and investing

Low-interest debt (<5%):
  → Invest while making minimum payments
```

## Asset Allocation Models

### Age-Based Rules

#### Rule of 100
```
Stock % = 100 - Your Age

Example:
- Age 30: 70% stocks, 30% bonds
- Age 50: 50% stocks, 50% bonds
- Age 65: 35% stocks, 65% bonds
```

#### Rule of 120 (more aggressive)
```
Stock % = 120 - Your Age

For longer lifespans and later retirement
```

### Risk-Based Allocation

#### Conservative (Risk Tolerance: Low)
```
Stocks: 20-40%
  - Large cap blue chip: 60%
  - Dividend stocks: 30%
  - Growth stocks: 10%

Bonds: 40-60%
  - Government bonds: 70%
  - Corporate bonds: 30%

Cash: 10-20%

Expected return: 4-7% annually
Max drawdown: ~10-15%
```

#### Balanced (Risk Tolerance: Medium)
```
Stocks: 50-70%
  - Large cap: 40%
  - Mid cap: 30%
  - Small cap: 20%
  - International: 10%

Bonds: 20-40%
  - Government: 50%
  - Corporate: 50%

Cash: 5-10%

Expected return: 7-10% annually
Max drawdown: ~15-25%
```

#### Aggressive (Risk Tolerance: High)
```
Stocks: 70-90%
  - Growth stocks: 50%
  - Small cap: 20%
  - International: 20%
  - Sector plays: 10%

Bonds: 5-20%
  - High yield: 50%
  - Corporate: 50%

Cash: 0-5%

Expected return: 10-15%+ annually
Max drawdown: ~25-40%
```

## Position Sizing

### Fixed Fractional Method
```
Formula: Position Size = (Account Size × Risk %) / (Entry - Stop)

Example:
- Account: $100,000
- Risk per trade: 2% ($2,000)
- Entry: $50
- Stop: $45 (10% below)
- Position Size = $2,000 / $5 = 400 shares ($20,000)

Result: 20% of account, but risk is only 2%
```

### Kelly Criterion (Advanced)
```
Formula: f* = (bp - q) / b

Where:
f* = fraction of capital to bet
b = odds received (reward/risk)
p = probability of winning
q = probability of losing (1-p)

Example:
- Win rate: 45%
- Reward/risk: 2:1
- f* = (2×0.45 - 0.55) / 2 = 0.175

→ Risk 17.5% of capital (use half: 8-9%)
```

### Volatility-Based Sizing
```
Formula: Position Size = (Risk Amount) / (ATR × Multiplier)

Where:
- ATR = Average True Range (14-day)
- Multiplier = 1.5-2.0

Example:
- Risk: $2,000
- ATR: $2
- Multiplier: 2
- Position Size = $2,000 / ($2 × 2) = 500 shares

Result: Volatility-adjusted position
```

## Stop Loss Strategies

### Percentage-Based
```
Conservative: 5-8% stop
Moderate: 8-12% stop
Aggressive: 12-15% stop

Pros: Simple, consistent
Cons: Ignores volatility
```

### Technical-Based
```
Support-based: Below recent low
MA-based: Below 20/50-day MA
Trend line: Below trend line
Pattern: Below pattern neckline

Pros: Market-aware
Cons: Can be wide stops
```

### Volatility-Based (ATR)
```
Stop = Entry - (1.5 to 2 × ATR)

Pros: Adapts to volatility
Cons: Can be very wide in volatile markets
```

### Time-Based
```
"If not profitable in X days, exit"

Pros: Prevents dead money
Cons: May exit good trades early
```

## Portfolio Rebalancing

### When to Rebalance

#### Time-Based
```
Quarterly: Most common
Semi-annually: Lower cost
Annually: Minimal trading

Pros: Disciplined, simple
Cons: May miss opportunities
```

#### Threshold-Based
```
Rebalance when allocation drifts >5% from target

Example:
- Target: 60% stocks / 40% bonds
- Trigger: 66% stocks / 34% bonds
- Action: Sell stocks, buy bonds

Pros: Market-responsive
Cons: More frequent trading
```

#### Hybrid Approach
```
Check quarterly, rebalance if drift >5%

Best of both worlds
```

### Rebalancing Method

#### Sell High, Buy Low
```
1. Identify overweight asset class
2. Sell portion to bring to target
3. Buy underweight asset class
4. Maintain overall allocation

Example:
- Stocks up to 70% (target 60%)
- Sell 10% of stocks
- Buy bonds with proceeds
```

#### Add New Money
```
1. Keep existing holdings
2. Direct new contributions to underweight
3. Gradually restore balance

Pros: No selling, tax-efficient
Cons: Slow, requires new money
```

## Risk Monitoring

### Daily Checks
```
- Portfolio value change
- Major position moves (>5%)
- Market news affecting holdings
- Margin usage (if applicable)
```

### Weekly Review
```
- Overall portfolio performance
- Individual position review

```

## Red Flags & Action Plan

### Warning Signs

#### Portfolio Drawdown
```
10% drawdown: Review positions, tighten stops
15% drawdown: Reduce risk, consider hedging
20% drawdown: Major review, defensive shift
25%+ drawdown: Emergency plan execution
```

#### Concentration Risk
```
Single position >20%: Trim position
Single sector >40%: Diversify
Single stock >10%: Set stop loss
```

#### Emotional Stress
```
Can't sleep: Reduce position sizes
Constant checking: Reduce monitoring frequency
Panic selling: Implement strict rules
FOMO buying: Stick to plan, avoid impulsive
```

### Emergency Actions

#### Market Crash Scenario
```
1. Don't panic
2. Review stop losses
3. Assess fundamentals
4. Consider hedging (puts, inverse ETF)
5. Maintain cash for opportunities
6. Stick to your plan
```

#### Personal Emergency
```
1. Calculate needed funds
2. Identify liquid assets
3. Sell in tax-efficient order
4. Maintain emergency fund
5. Rebuild when stable
```

## Hedging Strategies

### Basic Hedges

#### Cash Position
```
Keep 10-20% cash
- Reduces overall volatility
- Provides dry powder
- Psychological comfort
```

#### Defensive Sectors
```
Add to portfolio:
- Utilities
- Consumer staples
- Healthcare
- REITs

Reduces cyclical risk
```

#### Put Options
```
Buy puts on:
- Individual holdings (protective puts)
- Index (portfolio hedge)
- Sector (industry hedge)

Cost: Premium
Benefit: Downside protection
```

#### Inverse ETFs
```
Small positions in:
- Inverse index ETF
- Bear market ETF

Use for temporary hedging
```

## Advanced Risk Management

### Correlation Analysis
```
Goal: Avoid holding highly correlated assets

Check correlation matrix:
- Stocks vs bonds: Should be low/negative
- Different sectors: Moderate correlation OK
- Same sector: High correlation = risky

Action: Reduce positions with >0.8 correlation
```

### Stress Testing
```
Scenario 1: 2008-style crash (-50% market)
Scenario 2: Dot-com bubble (-70% tech)
Scenario 3: Personal emergency (need cash)
Scenario 4: Inflation spike (bonds down, stocks down)

How would your portfolio perform?
```

### Tail Risk Protection
```
For large portfolios (> $1M):

1. 5-10% in long-term puts
2. 5% in gold/precious metals
3. 5-10% cash equivalents
4. Diversified across asset classes

Goal: Survive extreme events
```

## Common Mistakes

### 1. No Stop Loss
```
Problem: Unlimited downside
Solution: Always use stops
```

### 2. Over-concentration
```
Problem: Single stock wipeout
Solution: Max 10% per position
```

### 3. Ignoring Correlation
```
Problem: False diversification
Solution: Check correlations
```

### 4. Emotional Decisions
```
Problem: Buy high, sell low
Solution: Written rules, automation
```

### 5. No Rebalancing
```
Problem: Drift from target allocation
Solution: Regular rebalancing
```

### 6. Chasing Performance
```
Problem: Buying at tops
Solution: Stick to your plan
```
