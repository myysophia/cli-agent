## Common Screening Mistakes

### 1. Over-focusing on P/E
```
Problem: Low PE can be value trap
Solution: Check growth, debt, trends
```

### 2. Ignoring Quality
```
Problem: High scores but bad business
Solution: Qualitative assessment matters
```

### 3. Backward Looking
```
Problem: Past performance ≠ future
Solution: Check trends, forward guidance
```

### 4. Ignoring Context
```
Problem: Same rules for all sectors
Solution: Adjust for industry norms
```

### 5. Too Strict Criteria
```
Problem: No stocks pass screening
Solution: Relax 1-2 criteria slightly
```
